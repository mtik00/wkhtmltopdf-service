# wkhtmltopdf-service
Yet another web app providing an interface to the awesome wkhtmltopdf binary.

This project is meant for my own projects that rely on `wkhtmltopdf`.  I'm trying
to dockerize my apps, and this will be very handy in doing that!

The hardest part about this is getting the fonts correct.

If you can't use this image directly, hopefully the `Dockerfile` can guide you
most of the way.
